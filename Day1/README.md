# Day 1: Find the Missing Number - November 14, 2023

## Problem Overview
The challenge is to identify a missing number in an array. This array consists of `n` distinct numbers from a specific range, but one number within this range is absent. The problem was tackled for two different scenarios:
1. The range is from `0` to `n`.
2. The range is from `n` to `m`.

## Key Concepts
- **Arithmetic Series:** Application of the sum formula.
- **Algorithm Efficiency:** Avoiding brute force through efficient solutions.
- **Programming Constructs:** Utilizing loops for iteration.
- **Edge Case Management:** Consideration for special cases in input.

## Solutions
### 1. Range `0` to `n`
   - **Approach:** Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and subtract the array's sum to find the missing number.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 2. Range `n` to `m`
   - **Approach:** Modify the formula to cater to the `n` to `m` range. The missing number is identified in a similar manner.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Programming Languages
- Python
- Java
