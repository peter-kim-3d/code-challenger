# Coding Study History

## Introduction
Welcome to my coding study history repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey through diverse coding challenges and problems. Each day, I delve into different programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. The dual purpose of this repository is:
1. To record and reflect upon my coding practice and learning.
2. To practice and enhance my skills in utilizing and customizing ChatGPT (like creating my own GPTs), thereby improving my ability to interact with and adapt AI tools for learning and problem-solving.

## Structure
- **Daily Folders:** Each day's work is organized in its own folder, e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.
- **Problem Descriptions:** Each folder contains a `problem.md` file detailing the specific problem tackled that day.
- **Solutions and Summaries:** Alongside the problem description, you'll find a `README.md` with a summary of the solutions and key learning points.
- **Source Code:** Code files in different programming languages are included in each day's folder.

## Goals
- **Consistent Practice:** To enhance coding skills through daily challenges.
- **Learning and Reflection:** To document the learning process and reflect on each problem-solving experience.
- **ChatGPT Interaction:** To practice and refine my skills in using and customizing ChatGPT for diverse applications.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** To share insights and solutions with others.

## Navigation
- [Day 1: Find the Missing Number](/Day1/README.md) - [Problem Statement](/Day1/problem.md)
- [Day 2](/Day2/README.md) - [Problem Statement](/Day2/problem.md) *(Links to be updated as I progress)*
- ... *(and so on)*

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python, Java, etc.
- **Tools:** GitHub, various IDEs, and ChatGPT.

## Using This Repository
Feel free to browse the problems, solutions, and summaries. The `problem.md` in each folder offers a detailed look at the challenge addressed, while the `README.md` provides insights into the solutions and learnings.

## Contributions and Feedback
This is a personal journey of learning and improvement in both coding and AI interaction, but I welcome any constructive feedback or contributions to refine the approaches and solutions in this repository.
